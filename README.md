## Overview

This repository houses the B.Tech minor project aimed at automating the registration process within our college. The existing registration system has been traditional and time-consuming, prompting the development of a streamlined portal accessible to both administrators and students.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Students log in using their IIIT Pune college Gmail IDs, gaining access to their user profile and a comprehensive registration guide upon successful Google sign-up.

- **Registration Form Submission:** Students are required to fill out a registration form, and the project incorporates multiple levels of verification (v1, v2, and v3). The process advances through each level sequentially.

- **Admin Portal:** Administrators have access to various features, including student verification, statistical data visualization (overall statistics, charts comparing verified vs. pending, and rejected vs. verified cases).

- **Email Notification:** Upon successful registration, students receive a welcome email.

## Security and Robustness

The project prioritizes security and robustness by implementing isolation for each independent portal. To bypass protective measures, users must undergo verification and pass through multiple middlewares.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack for this project includes:

- Redis
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js
- Nodemailer
- Passport.js
- D3.js
- Chart.js
- EJS

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to streamline and modernize the registration process for students at IIIT Pune, replacing the traditional and time-consuming methods with an efficient and user-friendly portal.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback or contribute to its development!
